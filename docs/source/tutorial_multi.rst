Tutorial (multiclass)
=====================

This tutorial goes through the steps of multiclass detection and 
delineation (e.g. species mapping, disease mapping). A guide to single 
class prediction is available
`here <https://patball1.github.io/detectree2/tutorial.html>`_. The multiclass
process is more complicated than single class prediction as the classes need to
be correctly encoded in the data.

The key steps are:

1. Preparing data
2. Training models
3. Evaluating model performance
4. Making landscape level predictions
